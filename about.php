                            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                            <p>"Masud Parves Library" is a non-profitable, non-political, voluntary,
                                charitable, social, knowledge and information center. It started its
                                activities, mainly through collecting funds, in March, 2011 when the
                                founder was studying in University of Trento, Italy. Since then, it has been
                                collecting money from friends around the world aiming to establish a
                                library with modern facilities at Soalia village in Shyamnagar thana of
                                Satkhira district, Bangladesh. <br> <br>
                                To contribute in human resource and economic development by
                                providing educational logistics to the students and information for

                            <h4>Logo design and the explanation of the logo</h4>
                            <p>The library logo has been designed by the Architect Farid Ahmed Sumon.
                                The picture on the logo represents "book being read by or turning pages
                                of a book by a reader". With different size of the pages, we mean,
                                variations in learners' abilities and intelligences. The underlying
                                assumption is that although the pages are different in color, they are of
                                same size and belong to the same book. This would also connotate that
                                MPL considers each learner as important, and believes in differences, but
                                not deficiencies. <br> <br>
                                MPL is the short form of Masud Parves Library; while "little contribution to
                                a great change" represents someone's little contribution to
                                mankind/society, whatever it might be initially, it can possibly generate a
                                great impact on the society over time. Masud Parves Library believes in it
                                and will try to materialize the same.
                                The nearly green color on the logo represents the traditional villages of
                                Bangladesh where MPL intends to work for human resource and economic
                                development.

                            <h4>Message from the founder</h4>
                            <p>Soalia Parves Library (SPL) began its
                                planned efforts through placing its first
                                foundation stone in May, 2012 right after
                                my return to Bangladesh from Europe.
                                SPL is an independent initiative having
                                no religious or political mandate. The
                                organization roots its vision and mission
                                in empowering villagers and students to
                                achieve necessary life skills for economic
                                development. In order for the villagers
                                and students to be able to contribute
                                substantially to their economic growth,
                                the organization provides skills specific
                                educational, technical and information
                                supports. <br> <br>
                                SPL also intends to help its beneficiaries build leadership skills by
                                involving the students in governing the library. In this new leadership
                                framework, leadership is distributed directly to Students, some of who act
                                as executive committee members. These trained executive members
                                provide in house capacity building training to the general students. I
                                believe this approach to leadership development will help students be
                                confident and competent in their future professional life.
